## The Challenge: Self-Hosting F/OSS

![bg right:30% opacity:80%](./images/messy-server-room.png)

- **The Sovereignty Imperative:** Growing need to break free from vendor lock-in and regain true data control.

But:

- **Complexity Overload:** Infrastructure, configuration, ongoing maintenance.
- **Significant Time Sink:** Diverts focus from core missions & innovation.
- **Security Burdens:** Self-managed systems are constant targets.

The “Linux Distribution” model invented in the 90s works well for infrastructure services and desktop applications, but has not been extended successfully to Web applications


---

## Introducing Hop3: Your Open-Source PaaS

![bg right:30% opacity:70%](./images/it-boss.png)

- **The Hop3 Solution:** An Open-Source PaaS engineered to conquer self-hosting hurdles.
- **Holistic Lifecycle Management:** From build & deploy to maintain, secure, & backup.
- **Empowering You:** Uncompromising control over your infrastructure & data.
- **Strategic Objectives:**
    - Boost internal operational efficiency & resilience.
    - Enable robust, sovereign client-facing SaaS offerings.
- **Our Mission:** To make F/OSS deployment **effortless, secure, and universally accessible**.

## What is Hop3: Today & Tomorrow

![bg opacity:.3](images/cityscape.png)

- **Today (Q2 2025):**
    - Single-server PaaS for F/OSS web apps.
    - `git push` deployment, `hop3.toml` declarative configuration.
    - OCI image builds (Docker concepts, flexible runtime) and "virtual environment" builds (more lightweight)
    - Growing catalog of easily deployable F/OSS applications.
- **Short-Term Roadmap (Q3-Q4 2025):**
    - Comprehensive multi-server, distributed application orchestration.
    - Advanced security, user management (SSO/RBAC), rich Web UI.
    - A vibrant application marketplace & active global community.
    - (Optional) Nix Integration: For Hop3 itself, app builders, reproducible environments, isolation.

## Core Principles & Architecture

![bg opacity:.2](images/blueprint-black.png)

---

## Guiding Principles: The Hop3 DNA

- **12-Factor App Adherence:** Foundation for scalability, maintainability, resilience.
- **Beyond the 12 Factors:** Security-by-Design, Ethical Considerations, Sustainability.
- **Key Values Driving Development:**
    - Sovereignty, Security, Sustainability
    - Simplicity, Efficiency, Inclusivity
- **Lean & Agile:** Minimal dependencies for a robust, efficient platform.
- **Designed for Efficiency:** Runs on low-cost hardware, entry-level VPS; lightweight & energy-conscious.

---

## Architectural Overview: Tech Stack

![bg left:40% opacity:70%](./images/stack.png)

- **Primary Language:** Python 3.10+ (Robust, extensive ecosystem)
- **Runtime Agent:** Python also
- **Standard Tooling:** Leveraging OCI/Docker *concepts* for image building, Git, SSH. (Runtime is flexible, moving towards Nix)
- **Declarative Configuration:** `hop3.toml` (primary), Procfile compatibility.
- **Web UI (Hypermedia-Driven Approach):**
    - Backend: Flask, SQLAlchemy
    - Frontend: Tailwind CSS, Datastar (Modern, efficient)

---

## Lineage & Synergy: Piku & Nua

![bg right:40% opacity:70%](images/inspirations.png)

- **Inspiration:** FreedomBlox, YunoHost, Dokku, and especially Piku & Nua.
- **Building on Experience:** Reuses code and learnings from Piku & Nua (Abilian's 2021 PaaS).
- **Nua:** Was container-based, provided full lifecycle management.
- **Hop3's Distinct Approach:** Initially non-containerized for leanness, will integrate concepts and code from Nua to support containers; also, Nix tooling, as an alternative.
- **Synergistic Future:** Exploring future integrations, potentially merging strengths for a unified platform.

---

## Extensible Plugin Architecture

![bg left:40% opacity:70%](images/blocks.png)

- **Core Design Philosophy:** Modular and plugin-based for ultimate flexibility.
- **Seamless Integration:** Easily adapt to new technologies, languages, and backing services.
- **Future-Proofing Hop3:** Ensures long-term adaptability and relevance, as well as community contributions.
- **Crucial for Ecosystems:** Key for supporting various build tools, runtimes, distributed external systems.

## Use Cases

![bg opacity:.1](./images/people-working.png)

---

## Hop3 in Action: Dogfooding & Vision

- **Internal Use (Dogfooding):**
    - ~12 websites, SaaS, customer apps at Abilian.
- **Future Vision:** Effortless deployment for complex apps:
  - **SDOs** (Software Developing Organisations): Streamline deployment workflows with GitOps and CI/CD, enabling efficient application lifecycle management and simplified infrastructure control.
  - **SMEs**: Reduce IT costs and maintain sovereignty by hosting essential applications (Digital Workspaces, CRMs, ERPs or e-commerce…), on a user-friendly, self-managed cloud platform.
  - **R&D Collaboration**: Hop3 provides an open, extensible platform with a modular architecture and plug-in system, making it ideal for collaborative experimentation with and advancing new approaches in cloud computing (orchestration, resource optimization, edge integration….).

---

## Key Features: Power & Simplicity

- **Simplified Configuration** (compared to, e.g., Kubernetes)
- **User Management & Access** (SSO, RBAC)
- **Automated Backups & Restore**
- **Monitoring & Logs**
- **Admin Processes**
- **Web Management Interface**
- **Multi-Technology Support:** Python, PHP, Node.js, Ruby, Go, Java, Rust...
- **Reproducible Builds** (Nix integration key)

(NB: some of these features are planned for the end of 2025).
